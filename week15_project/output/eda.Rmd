```{r setup, include=FALSE}
df = read.csv('../data/OnlineNewsPopularity.csv')
```

```{r}
str(df)
```

Structure of the data, almost completely numeric. `shares` is the target variable, and all but `url` and `timedelta` are predictive of the target. `timedelta` is probably not that useful (days between the article publication and the dataset acquisition (non-predictive)) and `url` is probably useful just for pulling out the article name if we need it.

```{r}
summary(df)
```

```{r}
num = df[, sapply(df, is.numeric)]
cor(num)
```
